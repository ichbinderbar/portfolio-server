    "description": "In this video, I, Juan, the creator of Fish20, explain how to play the game. The goal is to earn 20 coins before your opponent by strategically collecting cards. I demonstrate how to select cards from the table and use a hook card to capture them. Viewers are instructed on card types, capturing rules, and earning points.
